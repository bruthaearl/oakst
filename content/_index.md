I'm a "fuller stack" embedded systems engineer and IoT developer with experience in
front-end, back-end, and edge hardware systems. 

I have many different different hobbies, none of which I'm very good at and only a few of which I actually enjoy.


This is Oak St. Electronics, my personal notebook and portfolio.
