### Converting my old website 
My last site was a single-page Angular application and this new one is statically generated by Hugo.
This is my first time ever touching static generation and I've been enjoying the hell out of it.

### Shooting on film
Back throughout college I carried around a few 35mm point-and-shoot cameras but all of the film labs in my
area closed down and it got increasingly expensive to shoot on film. The pictures were usually terrible
but I liked the candid look the cheap film and cheap cameras gave the images. My buddy Ryan still shoots
on 35mm and he's got me into devloping my own film. It's as much a science as it is an art.

### Working on my Master's
I've been working on my MSCpE for the last two years and I'm about to 
finish up my class for this summer semester. If all goes well I'll graduate in the Spring!
