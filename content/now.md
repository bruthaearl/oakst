### Teleworking, sometimes
COVID has got me teleworking about half the time. It all depends on if anything important is going down at the office.

### Flexing my green thumb
Gardening has made really appreciate how easy it is to buy food from a grocery store. 

### Working on my Master's
I've been working on my degree in Computer Engineering for the last two years and my
summer class just wrapped up. If all goes well I'll graduate in the Spring!
